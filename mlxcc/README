ABOUT 

mlxcc is a C API for communicating with Mark Logic. It provides an
implementation of the underlying wire protocol used to communicate with the
server and is based off of the Java XCC/J libraries provided by Mark Logic. The
goal of mlxcc is to provide a base interface into Mark Logic in which bindings
into other popular languages can be built.

A few of the features mlxcc supports include: executing XQuery statements, bind
variables, and inserting content.

INSTALL

mlxcc has been known to build on Linux (Fedora/Debian) and Mac OS X. It requires
libcurl (http://curl.haxx.se) to compile. mlxcc runs against the Mark Logic
Content Interaction Server v3.0 and later.

To build and install run (see INSTALL for further details):
    ./configure
    make 
    make install

EXAMPLES

Example usage of the API can be found in the test/ directory. 

    * query.c - execute an XQuery statement with external variables
    * load.c - load content into Mark Logic
    
API Documentation can be found in the docs/api directory.

mlxcc is still very experimental and the API is subject to change. Any feedback,
patches, testing would be greatly appreciated.
